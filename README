				ABOUT

This script, called by dsbmc-cli, adds a new submenu ("Mounted Devices")
to your fluxbox menu if it doesn't exist yet. If a device was mounted, it
adds a submenu to the "Mounted Devices" menu, named after the device and
mount point. It contains two entries, one for "unmount", which executes
"dsbmc-cli -u ...", and one for "eject", which executes "dsbmc-cli -e ..".
If a device was unmounted, it removes the submenu entry for the device.

				USAGE

dsbmc-cli -L mount fb-unmount -m %d %m ';' -L unmount fb-unmount -u %d ';'

or with automount:

dsbmc-cli -a -L mount fb-unmount -m %d %m ';' -L unmount fb-unmount -u %d ';'
